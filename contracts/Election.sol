//So we need to use array like method candidates[0] of id [1] for name [2] for votecount
//type casting for value usage from psudo stuct candidate[0].toNumber()

//web3.eth.accounts no longer works
//do like this :var accounts = web3.eth.getAccounts()
//: truffle(development)>accounts to get all accounts to get single account do(Below)
// var account0;
//   web3.eth.getAccounts().then(function(result){
//     account0 = result[0];

//or web3.eth.getAccounts().then(e=> A1=e[0]);
